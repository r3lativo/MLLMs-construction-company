Builder: Mission has started.
Architect: hello again builder
Builder: hello
Architect: we will start using green blocks
Architect: i need you to build 4 green blocks straight from where you are standing, all on the ground
Builder: like this?
Architect: yes
Architect: now i need you to put a green block on either side of the second existing block, on the ground
Builder: so on the middle blocks?
Architect: they need to be attached to the same block, preferable to the one closer to you
Architect: so it looks like a cross
Builder: like this?
Architect: perfect
Architect: now, i need you to place a block diagonal from one of those new blocks, in the forward direction
Builder: like a cactus?
Architect: yes perfect
Architect: now we are done with the green
Architect: can you place a red block above the 4 greens with a space in between the green line and the new block?
Builder: here?
Architect: just need 1 block space in between the green and the new red block
Builder: oh i see
Architect: yes like that
Architect: now can you place 4 yellow blocks on each flat side of the red block?
Builder: its a flower!
Architect: yes it is, you are very observant builder
Architect: to finish, we need 4 orange blocks to fill in the corners of the 3x3 head of the flower
Architect: good job builder, we have successfully completed our mission!
Builder: good job!
