        "prompt": "You will be shown some dialogues among two agents, an Architect and a Builder. The dialogues were collected during a collaborative building task, were the Architect was supposed to instruct the Builder on how to build a certain target structure. You will be provided some examples of dialogues among humans playing the same game. Based on those examples, your task is to judge how human-like and plausible each dialogue that you will be shown is, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means that the dialogue is very unnatural and easily detectable as artificia; 2 means that while the dialogue still sounds artificial, a restricted amount of human communication patterns seen in the examples are present; 3 means that although the dialogue is not entirely natural, a big portion of it resembles the human examples; 4 means that the dialogue is almost perfectly human-like and natural, with only very few occurrences of artificial-sounding and implausible utterances; 5 means that the dialogue is very human-like, it presents utterances and exchanges which closely resemble the ones seen in the example, thus being almost indistinguishable from the examples. Only answer with the number you think is best, without producing any other utterance."
