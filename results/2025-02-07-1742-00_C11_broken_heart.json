Please start by placing 9 blocks to form a 3x3 grid.\n\n2. Next, we need to add some color to the base. The base of the target structure has a red, yellow, and brown pattern. Please add the following blocks to the base:\n   - 4 red blocks\n   - 3 yellow blocks\n   - 2 brown blocks\n\n3. Now, let's add some height to the structure. The target structure has a tall, narrow column in the center. Please start by placing a single block on top of the base.\n\n4. Next, we need to add more blocks to the column. The column in the target structure is made up of alternating red and brown blocks. Please add the following blocks to the column:\n   - 4 red blocks\n   - 3 brown blocks\n\n5. Finally, we need to add the top of the structure. The top of the target structure is a single red block. Please place a single red block on top of the column.\n\n6. Great work! The Builder has successfully replicated the target structure. [FINISH] "
