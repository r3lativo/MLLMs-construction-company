Each level seems to alternate between red and purple blocks, with yellow blocks interspersed throughout.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the structure:\n\n- The base is a single large cube, which is red.\n- Above the base, there are two levels. The first level consists of a row of smaller cubes, alternating between red and purple. The second level has a similar pattern but includes yellow cubes as well.\n- On top of the second level, there is a third level with a mix of red, purple, and yellow cubes.\n\nNow, let's start building!
