Give clear and easy to follow instructions. Proceed step by step and avoid providing too many instructions all at once. The Builder will reply with the actions it took and, possibly, clarification questions. Acknowledge the Builder's actions and feedback in order to understand whether they are on the right track or not and to help them.

Start by placing a cube in the center of the grid where the target structure appears to have its central cube. This should be a green cube.\n2. Next, place two purple cubes on either side of the central cube, forming a symmetrical pattern. These should be placed diagonally from the corners of the central cube.\n3. Now, add two red cubes on the opposite sides of the purple cubes. These should also be placed diagonally from the corners of the purple cubes.\n4. Finally, place one more green cube on top of the central cube, aligning it with the other green cubes in the structure.\n\nPlease let me know when you have completed these steps so I can provide further guidance if needed.
