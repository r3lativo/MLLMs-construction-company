From what I can see, there are several green and yellow cubes forming the main body of the structure. We should begin by placing these cubes in the correct positions.\n\nFor the green cubes, let's place them first. They seem to form a central cube, which is surrounded by other cubes. Please ensure that the green cubes are placed in such a way that they create a solid core for the structure.\n\nOnce the green cubes are in place, we can move on to the yellow cubes. These cubes appear to be arranged around the green cubes, creating a sort of frame. Make sure to position the yellow cubes so that they surround the green ones evenly.\n\nRemember to keep the structure symmetrical as much as possible.
