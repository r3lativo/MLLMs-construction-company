You will be shown images of a target structure built in a voxel world, and your job is to guide the Builder in order to replicate it. The Builder has no access to the target structure. Give clear and easy to follow instructions. Proceed step by step and avoid providing too many instructions all at once. The Builder will reply with the actions it took and, possibly, clarification questions. Acknowledge the Builder's actions and feedback in order to understand whether they are on the right track or not and to help them. When you think that the Builder correctly completed the structure, output '[FINISH]' to trigger the end of the game. Here are the images of the target structure from four points of view: "

Your goal is to replicate the target structure as described by the Architect, step by step.

IMPORTANT: Each action must add or remove exactly one block at a specific coordinate. Ensure that every coordinate is specified using integers only (e.g., 2, not 2.5). When acting, provide your moves in JSON format that lists block coordinates, actions, and chosen colors. Valid colors are: blue, yellow, green, orange, purple, and red. Include your confidence level (from 0.0 to 1.0) and, if needed, a clarifying question in your JSON. Example format: {\"add\": [[x,y,z,\"color\"]], \"remove\": [[x,y,z,\"color\"]], \"confidence\": 0.0, \"question\": \"...\"}. Do not add any extra dialogue."
