Acknowledge the Builder's actions and feedback in order to understand whether they are on the right track or not and to help them.

This cube should be colored in a way that matches the central cube in the target image.\n\nOnce the central cube is placed, the Builder should place cubes around it to form the outer edges of the grid. These cubes should be colored in the same pattern as the central cube.\n\nAfter the outer edges are completed, the Builder should place cubes in the remaining spaces of the grid, ensuring that they follow the same pattern as the central cube and the outer edges.\n\nPlease let me know when you have placed the cubes according to these instructions.
