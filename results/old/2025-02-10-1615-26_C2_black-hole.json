You will be shown images of a target structure built in a voxel world, images of a target structure built in a voxel world, and a JSON text file representing the target structure, and your job is to guide the Builder in order to replicate it. Give clear and easy to follow instructions. Proceed step by step and avoid providing too many instructions all at once. The Builder will reply with the actions it took and, possibly, clarification questions. Acknowledge the Builder's actions and feedback in order to understand whether they are on the right track or not and to help them.
