## Project Overview
This project explores the interaction between multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in achieving a shared goal within a collaborative building task. Inspired by prior work such as "Large Language Models as Minecraft Agents" (Madge & Poesio, 2024) and "Collaborative Dialogue in Minecraft" (Narayan-Chen et al., 2019), our focus is on communicative efficiency and reasoning rather than direct gameplay. 

The Architect agent provides human-like, multimodal instructions based on images of the target structure and evolving environment, while the Builder agent interprets these instructions and simulates actions and feedback. The dataset includes dialogue, screenshots, and logs, enabling a grounded analysis of task-oriented communication.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Raw dataset files and aligned preprocessed data.
- `src/`: All source code files.
  - `data_preprocessing.py`: Preprocesses and aligns dialogues, logs, and screenshots.
  - `MLLMs.py`: Load the models.
  - `evaluation.py`: Evaluates task success, dialogue efficiency, and error recovery.
  - `main.py`: Orchestrates the entire pipeline.
- `results/`: Logs, evaluation reports, and outputs from interactions.
- `environment.yml`: store the needed information to replicate the environment in which the experiment happened.
